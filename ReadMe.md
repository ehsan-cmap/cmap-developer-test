# CMAP Developer Test

- The aim of this test is to give us an idea about how you approach the development and maintenance of web applications.

- You will work from a GitHub repository which contains an existing web application.

- We are looking for a solution that shows how you build maintainable and robust software.

- The test is based on an overly simplified version of our business domain.

- The existing application adds timesheets and stores them to an in-memory database. The in-memory database is used to simplify the infrastructure.  

## Objective 1

We need you to code review the existing 'Add Timesheet' functionality and unit test. Add your code review comments to the 'Add-Timesheet-Code-Review.md' file

## Objective 2

We need you to add functionality to the Timesheets web application so that all timesheets stored in memory can be viewed and sorted by hours worked.

**User Story: As a user I want to view all timesheets on the UI once several have been added so that I can determine who has logged the most hours against a project.**

## Objective 3

We need you to add functionality to the Timesheets web application so that all timesheets stored in memory are downloadable in CSV file format.

**User Story: As a user I want to download all timesheets in CSV file format so that I can store them for reference.**

## Deliverables

- Your code should have good unit test coverage.

- Your solution should be delivered via GitHub. If you are not able to fork this original repository publicly then please fork to a private repository and then provide us with the zip file from the download option in GitHub.

## Guidance

- Showing your commit history is recommended so that we can see your approach.

- You can take as long as you need to complete this assignment. But do remember that this is throwaway code and the aim is to demonstrate your approach rather than build a complete system.

- You do not need to deploy the application.

- If you have forked our repo then your solution will be visible to others, so please delete your repo once it has been reviewed.
